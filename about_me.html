    I was born in Southern California.
    I had good people who wished nothing but the best for me.
    When I was very young, I knew that I wanted to accomplish something groundbreaking.
    I wanted to provide something for society to be able to thrive.

    <br /><br />

    I saw others around me who knew what they wanted to do when they grew up.
    They told me they wanted to be athletes, doctors, scientists, etc.
    They always knew they wanted to become their dream selves.
    I wanted to become many different things that came from my interests.
    Logically, it would be impossible for me to accomplish everything I wanted.
    However, a gut feeling deep inside me told me to be someone impactful.
    Someone who would have a legacy equivalent to Abraham Lincoln or Winston Churchill.

    <br /><br />

        
    I didn’t know what i needed to do, but I knew I had to do something on this earth.
    In order to do this, I required knowledge because, as they say, knowledge is power, which helped me cultivate my outlook on life. 
    I searched and searched for the knowledge to quench my thirst for wisdom.
    I pursued many interests over many years that caught my eye. Drawing, music, robotics, science, and writing.
    I've learned a lot from the wise teachers and mentors I’ve found around me.
    I found them to be crucial for my development as a person.
    Then, sooner or later, I began noticing progress and growth.
    I created better artwork over time, I got better at playing music, and I gained knowledge that walked me through life.
    I’ve learned numerous lessons during my existence. I understood what it meant to accomplish goals and find purpose.
